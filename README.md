Plex album downloader - Download and save all images from a Plex album.  Edit `index.js` and set your Plex credentials and album
name.  

To rotate to the correct orientation based on EXIF flags after
downloading, use `exiftran -i -a *.jpg`.  This allows images to be
displayed correctly on inexpensive picture frames.
